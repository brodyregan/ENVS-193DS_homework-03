## Problem 1:
## a.
[I could calculate the mean amount of time I practice at each location to compare how long I tend to practice at the studio or at home. This comparison would be informative because the studio has less distractions, likely encouraging me to practice longer than I do at home.]

## b.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data <- read_csv("../data/ENVS 193 Data - Sheet1 (2).csv") |> 
  clean_names()
```

```{r}
 summary_data <- data |>
  group_by(location) |>
  summarise(
    mean_duration = mean(duration_hr),
    sd_duration = sd(duration_hr)
  )
view(summary_data)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = location, y = duration_hr, color = location)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.6, size = 2) +
  geom_point(data = summary_data, aes(x = location, y = mean_duration), 
             shape = 23, size = 4, fill = "black") +
  geom_errorbar(data = summary_data, aes(x = location, ymin = mean_duration - sd_duration, ymax = mean_duration + sd_duration),
                width = 0.2, color = "black", inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Home" = "blue", "Studio" = "orange")) +
  labs(
    title = "Practice Duration by Location",
    x = "Practice Location",
    y = "Practice Duration (hours)"
  ) +
  theme_light(base_size = 14) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## c. 
[Figure 1: Practicing in the studio tends to allow for longer practice time. Data Source: Brody Regan. Points represent observations of practice time (in hours) at practice location (Home or Studio). The center black diamond represents the mean time, and error bars show ±1 standard deviation), both respective to their site. Colors represent location (blue = home, orange = studio).]

## d. 

```{r}
data_summary <- data |>
  group_by(location) |>
  summarize(
    mean_duration = round(mean(duration_hr), 1),
    sd_duration = round(sd(duration_hr), 1),
    count = n()
  )

# Create gt table
data_summary |>
  gt() |>
  cols_label(
    location = "Practice Location",
    mean_duration = "Mean Duration (hours)",
    sd_duration = "SD (hours)",
    count = "Number of Sessions"
  ) |>
  tab_header(title = "Practice Duration Summary by Location")

```


## Problem 2:
## a.
[Affective visualization for my data will take inspiration from the painted quilt using colored strips. The color of each strip will represent the instrument practiced and the opacity of it will represent the amount practiced in one session. This creates a sense of emotion and energy because the longer practices will have more extreme (bright) colors, while less time will have lighter colors. I would also like to include a shape for each bar and have the size correspond to the amount of meals ate. For example, larger shapes represent more meals ate before practicing that day.]

## c.
```{r draft-quilt, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}

visual_data <- read_csv("../data/ENVS 193 Data - Sheet1 (2).csv") |>  #import csv file from data folder 
  mutate(SessionID = row_number())#assign sequential order for each practice session

palette <- c( #define color palette
  "Drums" = "red",#red for drums
  "Guitar" = "#1976D2", #blue code for guitar
  "Bass" = "green"#green for guitar
)

ggplot(visual_data, aes(x = SessionID, y = 1, #load data, put each session along x-axis, fixed y position
               fill = `Instrument Practiced:`, #color by instrument
               alpha = `Duration (hr)` / max(`Duration (hr)`))) + #make the hue/opacity proportional to the practice time
  geom_tile(width = 0.9, height = 0.6) + #create horizontal strips with parameters
  geom_point(aes(size = `Meals Ate:`), shape = 21, color = "black", fill = "white") + #overlay circles (not squares), make the size proportional, styled circle points 
  scale_fill_manual(values = palette) + #apply custom fill
  scale_alpha(range = c(0.3, 1), guide = "none") + #set opacity range, and remove legend
  scale_size_area(max_size = 6) + #set max size
  theme_void() + #set alternative theme to remove axis and grid 
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom", #place new legend at bottom
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = "bold")
  ) + #center the title and make it bold
  labs(
    title = "Rhythmic Strips: A Semester of Practice", #label title
    fill = "Instrument", #label instrument for legend
    size = "Meals Ate" #label meals ate for legend
  )

```


## d.
[1. My piece is representing aspects that affect my practice time. The colors show the type of instrument, and the circles/size of circle show how many meals I ate before practicing that day. The lighter the fill color, the shorter amount of time I practiced. 
2. I found Lorraine Woodruff-Long’s warming strips quilt to be an inspiring piece. I used a similar color scheme and geometric shapes to convey an emotional view of practice time. 
3. This visualization was created from written code in R studio.
4. I created this by first loading the data set and writing the code for the ggplot/tiles. Then through online research and help from AI I was able to fill in the rest of the code through trial and error. ]


## Problem 3: 
## a. 
![Photo](../data/surgeonfish.jpg)
[The statistical test the author's are using to answer the main research questions are generalized linear models. This is a logistic regression. The purpose of this test was to see how algal length influences suction and ventral expansion during feeding. They also used a generalized least squares model determine differences in the first and second jaw opening.]

## b.
[The authors did a good presenting the statistical trends that were discovered. The x-axis clearly shows time in ms while the y-axis shows fin protraction in mm. Although not explicitly explained, the horizontal dashed line at y = 0 acts as a visual baseline for understanding movement of the fins. The raw data points are not plotted, but included are the mean values with error bars which represent the range of data collected. The visualization of the trailing and leading edge of the fish are well shown by the inclusion of fish diagrams above the graph.]


## c.
[The authors handled visual clutter relatively well in the figure by limiting it to only 2 clearly labeled curves. There are no grid-lines, only a center horizontal line. There is also a lack of text on the figure, relying more on the imagery. The data to ink ratio is high considering most visual elements support the data collected.]

## d. 
[To improve this figure, I would recommend adding a legend for color coding within the plot area itself. There are multiple background colors such as dark blue, grey, light blue, and yellow that need to be defined. I would also include marked points with text to show the different phases of feeding, such as ventral pull or protraction. These could be added to the x-axis or as points along the curves.]
