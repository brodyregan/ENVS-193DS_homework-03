## Problem 1:
## a.
[I could calculate the mean amount of time I practice at each location to compare how long I tend to practice at the studio or at home. This comparison would be informative because the studio has less distractions, likely encouraging me to practice longer than I do at home.]

## b.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data <- read_csv("ENVS 193 Data - Sheet1 (2).csv") |> 
  clean_names()
```

```{r}
 summary_data <- data |>
  group_by(location) |>
  summarise(
    mean_duration = mean(duration_hr),
    sd_duration = sd(duration_hr)
  )
view(summary_data)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = location, y = duration_hr, color = location)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.6, size = 2) +
  geom_point(data = summary_data, aes(x = location, y = mean_duration), 
             shape = 23, size = 4, fill = "black") +
  geom_errorbar(data = summary_data, aes(x = location, ymin = mean_duration - sd_duration, ymax = mean_duration + sd_duration),
                width = 0.2, color = "black", inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Home" = "blue", "Studio" = "orange")) +
  labs(
    title = "Practice Duration by Location",
    x = "Practice Location",
    y = "Practice Duration (hours)"
  ) +
  theme_light(base_size = 14) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## c. 
[Figure 1: Practicing in the studio tends to allow for longer practice time. Data Source: Brody Regan. Points represent observations of practice time (in hours) at practice location (Home or Studio). The center black diamond represents the mean time, and error bars show Â±1 standard deviation), both respective to their site. Colors represent location (blue = home, orange = studio).]

## d. 

```{r}
data_summary <- data |>
  group_by(location) |>
  summarize(
    mean_duration = round(mean(duration_hr), 1),
    sd_duration = round(sd(duration_hr), 1),
    count = n()
  )

# Create gt table
data_summary |>
  gt() |>
  cols_label(
    location = "Practice Location",
    mean_duration = "Mean Duration (hours)",
    sd_duration = "SD (hours)",
    count = "Number of Sessions"
  ) |>
  tab_header(title = "Practice Duration Summary by Location")
